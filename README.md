## Output

- Creates a new directory named `[original_filename]_parts` in the same location as the input video.
- Segments are named `[original_filename]_part001.[extension]`, `[original_filename]_part002.[extension]`, etc.
- Maintains original video codec (H.264 output) and container format.
- Provides a detailed job summary upon completion.

## Features in Detail

### Hardware Acceleration
- Automatically detects VideoToolbox on Apple Silicon Macs.
- **VBR Encoding:** Uses `h264_videotoolbox` hardware encoder if available for faster processing.
- **CBR Encoding:** Intentionally uses `libx264` software encoder to ensure strict adherence to the target bit rate, even if hardware acceleration is available.
- Falls back to `libx264` software encoding if hardware acceleration is unavailable or not applicable (e.g., CBR).

### Video Quality
- Preserves original resolution.
- Allows custom output frame rate (or maintains original).
- Uses the original bit rate as the target for encoding.
- Copies the audio stream directly (`-c:a copy`) without re-encoding to preserve audio quality.

### Bit Rate Control Options
1.  **Constant Bit Rate (CBR):**
    *   Aims to maintain a consistent bit rate throughout the video.
    *   Uses the exact bit rate from the source video as the target.
    *   Uses the `libx264` software encoder with strict parameters (`nal-hrd=cbr`, `force-cfr=1`, small `bufsize`, `veryslow` preset) for maximum accuracy. Ideal when a predictable bitrate is required.
    *   Encoding may be slower than VBR due to software encoding and `veryslow` preset.
2.  **Variable Bit Rate (VBR):**
    *   Allocates bits dynamically based on scene complexity (more bits for complex scenes, fewer for simple scenes).
    *   Generally provides a better quality-to-size ratio compared to CBR.
    *   Uses the original bit rate as the **target average** bit rate, allowing the encoder to exceed this rate for complex scenes (no hard maximum cap is set).
    *   Uses `h264_videotoolbox` hardware encoder if available (setting the target average via `-b:v`).
    *   Uses `libx264` software encoder in Average Bit Rate (ABR) mode if hardware encoding is unavailable (setting target average via `-b:v`).

### Splitting Options
1.  **By Number of Segments:**
    *   Enter the total number of segments desired.
    *   The script calculates the required segment duration.
2.  **By Duration:**
    *   Specify the exact duration (in seconds) for each segment.
    *   The script calculates the total number of segments.

## Performance

- VBR encoding benefits significantly from hardware acceleration when available.
- CBR encoding prioritizes accuracy over speed by using the `veryslow` preset with `libx264`.
- Audio stream copying is very fast and lossless.

## Known Limitations

- Output segments might be slightly longer or shorter than specified due to keyframe placement by the encoder. FFmpeg splits at the nearest keyframe before the specified time for `-ss` and cuts after the duration `-t` is reached.
- Hardware acceleration support is currently focused on Apple Silicon (VideoToolbox). Other hardware acceleration methods (like NVENC, QSV) are not implemented.
- Older versions of FFmpeg might have different behaviors or limitations with hardware encoders.
